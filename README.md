Install and configure the Wazuh indexer as a single-node or multi-node cluster on a 64-bit (x86_64/AMD64 or AARCH64/ARM64) architecture using the assisted installation method. The Wazuh indexer is a highly scalable full-text search engine. It offers advanced security, alerting, index management, deep performance analysis, and several other features.

Wazuh indexer cluster installation
The installation process is divided into three stages.

Initial configuration

Wazuh indexer nodes installation

Cluster initialization

Note You need root user privileges to run all the commands described below.
Initial configuration
Follow these steps to configure your Wazuh deployment, create SSL certificates to encrypt communications between the Wazuh components, and generate random passwords to secure your installation.

Download the Wazuh installation assistant and the configuration file.


curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.14/wazuh-install.sh
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.14/config.yml
Edit ./config.yml and replace the node names and IP values with the corresponding names and IP addresses. You need to do this for all Wazuh server, Wazuh indexer, and Wazuh dashboard nodes. Add as many node fields as needed.


nodes:
  # Wazuh indexer nodes
  indexer:
    - name: node-1
      ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"
    #- name: node-2
    #  ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"
    #- name: node-3
    #  ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"

  # Wazuh server nodes
  # If there is more than one Wazuh server
  # node, each one must have a node_type
  server:
    - name: wazuh-1
      ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: master
    #- name: wazuh-2
    #  ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: worker
    #- name: wazuh-3
    #  ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: worker

  # Wazuh dashboard nodes
  dashboard:
    - name: dashboard
      ip: "<dashboard-node-ip>"
Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --generate-config-files to generate the Wazuh cluster key, certificates, and passwords necessary for installation. You can find these files in ./wazuh-install-files.tar.


bash wazuh-install.sh --generate-config-files
Copy the wazuh-install-files.tar file to all the servers of the distributed deployment, including the Wazuh server, the Wazuh indexer, and the Wazuh dashboard nodes. This can be done by using the scp utility.

Wazuh indexer node installation
Follow these steps to install and configure a single-node or multi-node Wazuh indexer.

Download the Wazuh installation assistant. Skip this step if you performed the initial configuration on the same server and the Wazuh installation assistant is already in your working directory:


curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.14/wazuh-install.sh
Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --wazuh-indexer and the node name to install and configure the Wazuh indexer. The node name must be the same one used in config.yml for the initial configuration, for example, node-1.

Note Make sure that a copy of wazuh-install-files.tar, created during the initial configuration step, is placed in your working directory.

bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-indexer node-1
Repeat this stage of the installation process for every Wazuh indexer node in your cluster. Then proceed with initializing your single-node or multi-node cluster in the next stage.

Note For Wazuh indexer installation on hardened endpoints with noexec flag on the /tmp directory, additional setup is required. See the Wazuh indexer configuration on hardened endpoints section for necessary configuration.
Cluster initialization
The final stage of installing the Wazuh indexer single-node or multi-node cluster consists of running the security admin script.

Run the Wazuh installation assistant with option --start-cluster on any Wazuh indexer node to load the new certificates information and start the cluster.


bash wazuh-install.sh --start-cluster
Note You only have to initialize the cluster once, there is no need to run this command on every node.
Testing the cluster installation
Verify that the Wazuh indexer installed correctly and the Wazuh indexer cluster is functioning as expected by following the steps below.

Run the following command to get the admin password:


tar -axf wazuh-install-files.tar wazuh-install-files/wazuh-passwords.txt -O | grep -P "\'admin\'" -A 1
Run the following command to confirm that the installation is successful. Replace <WAZUH_INDEXER_IP_ADDRESS> with the IP address of the Wazuh indexer and use the password gotten from the output of the previous command:


curl -k -u admin https://<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP_ADDRESS>:9200
Output
{
  "name" : "node-1",
  "cluster_name" : "wazuh-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "095jEW-oRJSFKLz5wmo5PA",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "7.10.2",
    "build_type" : "rpm",
    "build_hash" : "db90a415ff2fd428b4f7b3f800a51dc229287cb4",
    "build_date" : "2023-06-03T06:24:25.112415503Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.6.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.10.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "The OpenSearch Project: https://opensearch.org/"
}
Run the following command to check if the cluster is working correctly. Replace <WAZUH_INDEXER_IP_ADDRESS> with the IP address of the Wazuh indexer and enter the password for the Wazuh indexer admin user when it prompts for password:


curl -k -u admin https://<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP_ADDRESS>:9200/_cat/nodes?v
The command output should be similar to the following:

Output
ip              heap.percent ram.percent cpu load_1m load_5m load_15m node.role node.roles                               cluster_manager name
192.168.107.240           19          94   4    0.22    0.21     0.20 dimr      data,ingest,master,remote_cluster_client *               node-1
Disable Wazuh updates
We recommend disabling the Wazuh package repositories after installing all components on this server to prevent accidental upgrades.

Execute the following command only after completing all installations:

APTYUMDNF

sed -i "s/^deb /#deb /" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list
apt update then second Installing the Wazuh server using the assisted installation method
Install the Wazuh server as a single-node or multi-node cluster on a 64-bit (x86_64/AMD64 or AARCH64/ARM64) architecture using the assisted installation method. The Wazuh server analyzes the data received from the Wazuh agents, triggering alerts when it detects threats and anomalies. This central component includes the Wazuh manager and Filebeat.

Wazuh server cluster installation
Download the Wazuh installation assistant. Skip this step if you installed Wazuh indexer on the same server and the Wazuh installation assistant is already in your working directory:


curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.14/wazuh-install.sh
Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --wazuh-server followed by the node name to install the Wazuh server. The node name must be the same one used in config.yml for the initial configuration, for example, wazuh-1:

Note Make sure that a copy of wazuh-install-files.tar, created during the initial configuration step, is placed in your working directory.

bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-server wazuh-1
Your Wazuh server is now successfully installed.

If you want a Wazuh server single-node cluster, everything is set and you can proceed directly with Installing the Wazuh dashboard using the assisted installation method.

If you want a Wazuh server multi-node cluster, repeat this process on every Wazuh server node.

Disable Wazuh updates
We recommend disabling the Wazuh package repositories after installing all components on this server to prevent accidental upgrades.

Execute the following command only after completing all installations:

APTYUMDNF

sed -i "s/^deb /#deb /" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list
apt update and Installing the Wazuh dashboard using the assisted installation method
Install and configure the Wazuh dashboard on a 64-bit (x86_64/AMD64 or AARCH64/ARM64) architecture using the assisted installation method. Wazuh dashboard is a flexible and intuitive web interface for mining and visualizing security events and archives.

Wazuh dashboard installation
Download the Wazuh installation assistant. You can skip this step if you have already installed Wazuh indexer on the same server.


curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.14/wazuh-install.sh
Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option --wazuh-dashboard and the node name to install and configure the Wazuh dashboard. The node name must be the same one used in config.yml for the initial configuration, for example, dashboard:

Note Make sure that a copy of wazuh-install-files.tar created during the Wazuh indexer installation is placed in your working directory.

bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-dashboard dashboard
The default Wazuh web user interface port is 443, used by the Wazuh dashboard. You can change this port using the optional parameter -p <PORT_NUMBER> or --port <PORT_NUMBER>. Some recommended ports are 8443, 8444, 8080, 8888, and 9000.

Once the Wazuh installation is completed, the output shows the access credentials and a message that confirms that the installation was successful.


INFO: --- Summary ---
INFO: You can access the web interface https://<WAZUH_DASHBOARD_IP_ADDRESS>
   User: admin
   Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>

INFO: Installation finished.
You now have installed and configured Wazuh. Find all passwords that the Wazuh installation assistant generated in the wazuh-passwords.txt file inside the wazuh-install-files.tar archive. Run the following command to print them:


tar -O -xvf wazuh-install-files.tar wazuh-install-files/wazuh-passwords.txt
Access the Wazuh web interface with your admin user credentials. This is the default administrator account for the Wazuh indexer and it allows you to access the Wazuh dashboard.

URL: https://<WAZUH_DASHBOARD_IP_ADDRESS>

Username: admin

Password: <ADMIN_PASSWORD>

When you access the Wazuh dashboard for the first time, the browser shows a warning message stating that the certificate was not issued by a trusted authority. An exception can be added in the advanced options of the web browser. For increased security, the root-ca.pem file previously generated can be imported to the certificate manager of the browser instead. Alternatively, you can configure a certificate from a trusted authority.

Disable Wazuh updates
We recommend disabling the Wazuh package repositories after installing all components on this server to prevent accidental upgrades.

Execute the following command only after completing all installations:

APTYUMDNF

sed -i "s/^deb /#deb /" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list
